# Cozy Spring Jam 2023
My first Game Jam! Grow some crops using the weather!

**Code and Art by: Moshir**  
**SFX and Music composed by: Ying Sheng Tan**

Don't expect much as we did this completely on our own working a total of 18 hours across 3 days for the game jam. 

This was an amazing experience and the first step in my journey to learn how to game dev! I would appreciate any kind of feedback and constructive criticism that you could provide, particularly with what was done well and what could have been done better. Though I hope at the very least you enjoy yourself and have fun!

## About Moshir  

 >My favorite food is sushi and my favorite color is orange. When I'm not working, I love to enjoy anime and games as well as a variety of other hobbies! I personally have some prior experience in coding with Java, but this is my first Game Jam and first time making a game, as well as first time doing art! I am pursing a career in programming, but would love to learn how to game dev and be able to one day create a great game! 

## About Tan  

 >This was my first time writing a soundtrack and figuring out how to create sound effects. This was also my first Game Jam and working on a game. When I'm not composing music, playing games and public speaking are my other hobbies! I will be studying music composition in college and I hope to compose soundtracks for games and films professionally in the future

Additionally I may upload a VOD of the entire 18-hour process! Let me know if you are interested.

>Hope you enjoy!
